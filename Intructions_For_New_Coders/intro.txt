        DOCUMENTATION FOR NEW MEMBERS
-----------------------------------------------
                    Intro
              ----------------
            Hello. If you're reading this, you most likely got invited here by either me (Tanner) or Emmet. 
This is the SusChat Foundation. The name is subject to change. We are working on this social media, and you are too. This is the helpful documentation written by Tanner for you to reference.


              ----------------
            1. Basic CSS
          ---------------
    Let's face it, you gotta start somewhere. You can't become super hackers like me and Emmet in a day. We're probably gonna start you off managing the CSS portion of things. If you don't know what CSS is, why the hell did we let you onto this project?!?!? Jokes aside, CSS is what makes the page look pretty. You're job is simple. If we severely mess up the looks of the page, you clean up our mess. If you do a good job, we promote you to our next position.

      -------------------------
            2. HTML
            --------
          So, you're good at CSS. That's nice and all, but now you're on the real stuff. You're gonna work on HTML. You basically add tags and give them IDs (for me to handle).  This is a good position and is rather respectable. When you eventually get promoted, you will become a JavaScript Dev.
            --------
          3. JavaScript
        ------------------
      Congrats. If you made it this far, you must really care about our project. You are close on the hierarchy with Emmet and I. However, with power comes challange. You are tasked to the hardest part of this operation. I now consider you an..equal? Perhaps. If you don't quit on us now, you have our undying respect, but there is a level higher than us believe it or not. You are legendary if you got this far. But, for the people with utmost expertise, comes the biggest obstacle yet. You are truly a god if you can solve....
						------------------------------
            4.  SERVER SIDE SCRIPTING
               ----------------------------
       Damn. Welcome to the biggest challenge of your life. You are forever commemorated as a founder if you can solve this. Emmet and I are in your favor at this point. The server side scripts will host messages and send them between users. That's tricky! Indeed it is, Emmet. But, we will help you. And with our combined intellect, we can officially launch this!  Alas, we will succeed and you will get 1/3 of the proceeds. There can only be 1 employee who can reach this position. A battle to the death, as well as a gamble? Seems enticing. To whoever reaches this rank, we will be forever in debt to you for helping us! 

            --------------------------------


    Well, that's about it. Work your way up and become the best programmer amongst our arsenal!

										Thanks For Helping!
