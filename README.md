# SusChatOfficial
This is a project not made to be popular. It is a social media that we work on in our free time. We are the first 7th graders
to ever make a social media.  If you have questions, or comments, goto the forum on the repo page.
# What we need
We need programmers who can help set up PHP, Server-side-hosting for send messages to all users on the site, and HTML designers.
# Help us
If you would like to help us, email suschatofficial@gmail.com.
Be sure to make the subject "Intrested" or "SusChat".
Leave your name, email/perfered contact method, and the coding language you know best out of JS, Normal Java, JSON, and HTML.  Do not put your facebook, snapchat, insta, or discord as your contact method. We work on this during school, and we are not allowed these sites.
##### Email Template
If you are too lazy to write a message, here is a link to a pre-written Email to us with places for name, contact method, and what you know more about.
